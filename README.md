## WHERE MY MONEY

WHERE MY MONEY is an app supporting those who can't seem to track down where their hard-earned money is going so quickly. 

The first page is a page that will let you either log into an existing account or create a new account. 

From here, you will be able to view your existing transactions/enter new transactions you've made and view your existing assets/enter new assets. 

WHERE MY MONEY was built using React with a Rails API that handles secure password protection.
